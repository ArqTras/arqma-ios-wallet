### Shared library building problems

You may get an error such as:
```
ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture armv7
```

If you get this issue then make sure that boost has been correctly built. You can check this by seeing if it exists at `Libraries/boost/builds/libs`. If the folder doesn't exist then run `./scripts/install_boost.sh` in the root director and check to see if any errors occur there.

### XCode Building problems
If you're having problems building with Xcode 10 or above then change to the `Legacy Build System`

> We use forked the repo of [ofxiOSBoost](https://github.com/Mikunj/ofxiOSBoost/). We do this ONLY for more convenient installation process.
